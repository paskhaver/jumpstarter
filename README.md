# Production Readme

**Jumpstarter** is a clone of the popular crowdfunding site Kickstarter
built on a Ruby on Rails backend and a React / Redux frontend.
The app operates as follows:

  - Users create a project with a fundraising goal
  - Users attach **rewards** to the projects that offer perks for donating to the project.
  - Other users make **pledges** to the project and receive rewards in exchange for their support.
  - The project moves closer to its fundraising goal.
